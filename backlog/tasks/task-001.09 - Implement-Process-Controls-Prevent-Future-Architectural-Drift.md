## Description

Implement automated process controls and validation mechanisms to prevent future architectural drift and ensure compliance with established patterns and principles.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create pre-commit hooks that validate code against architectural patterns
- [ ] Implement automated testing for SOLID principles compliance
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline checks for architectural decision record (ADR) compliance
- [ ] Create code review templates that include architectural compliance checks
- [ ] Implement automated dependency analysis to prevent architectural violations
- [ ] Add linting rules that enforce established coding patterns and conventions
- [ ] Create documentation validation to ensure specs match implementation
- [ ] Implement automated security scanning for authentication and authorization flows
- [ ] Add performance regression testing to maintain architectural quality
- [ ] Create architectural compliance dashboard for continuous monitoring
