## Description

Implement JIRA sprint discovery functionality that allows users to browse and select sprints from their JIRA boards for analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fetch sprints for selected boards
- [ ] Display sprint metadata (name, dates, status)
- [ ] Filter sprints by status (active, closed, future)
- [ ] Sort sprints by date, name, or status
- [ ] Sprint selection interface for analysis
- [ ] Bulk sprint selection capabilities

## Implementation Plan

1. **Sprint Discovery API** - Fetch sprints from JIRA boards
2. **Sprint Metadata Service** - Extract and format sprint information
3. **Filtering and Sorting** - Allow users to find specific sprints
4. **Selection Management** - Track user-selected sprints
5. **Bulk Operations** - Support multi-sprint selection

## Technical Notes

- Use JIRA Agile API for sprint data
- Handle different sprint states (open, closed, active)
- Support date range filtering
- Implement efficient pagination
