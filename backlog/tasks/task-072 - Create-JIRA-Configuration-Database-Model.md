## Description

Implement database model to store JIRA connection configurations securely with proper encryption for sensitive data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add created_at
- [ ] updated_at and last_tested_at timestamp fields

## Implementation Plan

1. Create JiraConfiguration model extending Base class for timestamp fields\n2. Include encrypted fields for sensitive data (api_token, password)\n3. Add configuration metadata and validation status fields\n4. Add last_tested_at timestamp for connection monitoring\n5. Create database migration for the new table\n6. Follow existing model patterns from base.py and field_mapping.py

## Implementation Notes


IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY:

✅ **JiraConfiguration Model Created**: 
- 
- Extends Base class with created_at, updated_at fields
- Includes last_tested_at timestamp field as required
- Uses proper encryption for sensitive fields (api_token, password)
- Follows existing model patterns from field_mapping.py

✅ **Database Migration Created**:
-  
- Creates jira_configurations table with all required fields
- Includes proper indexes and constraints
- Fixes migration chain conflicts

✅ **Model Integration**:
- Updated 
- JiraConfiguration available for import

✅ **Validation Passed**:
- Model instantiation works correctly
- Encryption/decryption for sensitive fields confirmed
- All timestamp fields present (created_at, updated_at, last_tested_at)
- Enum types and validation methods working
- Follows existing architectural patterns

READY FOR: test-engineer validation and service layer integration
