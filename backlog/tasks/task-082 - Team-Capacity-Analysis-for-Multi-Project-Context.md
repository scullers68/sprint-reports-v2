## Description

Enhance capacity management system to analyze how single team capacity is distributed across multiple projects within meta-board sprints, providing insights for resource allocation optimization.

## Implementation Plan

## Implementation Plan Based on Architecture Analysis

### Phase 1: Data Model Extensions (Priority 1)
1. Extend /backend/app/models/capacity.py with ProjectCapacityAllocation model
2. Add project-aware relationships to existing DisciplineTeamCapacity model
3. Create database migration for new model relationships

### Phase 2: Service Layer Implementation (Priority 2)  
4. Create /backend/app/services/capacity_service.py following existing service patterns
5. Implement capacity distribution analysis algorithms
6. Add capacity forecasting methods with project context
7. Create capacity conflict detection logic

### Phase 3: API Layer Extensions (Priority 3)
8. Extend /backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/capacity.py with multi-project endpoints
9. Add project-based capacity reporting endpoints
10. Implement capacity optimization recommendation APIs

### Phase 4: Analytics & Algorithms (Priority 4)
11. Create capacity utilization analytics algorithms
12. Implement historical capacity analysis methods
13. Add capacity optimization recommendation engine

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Priority 5)
14. Add comprehensive unit tests following existing test patterns
15. Ensure backward compatibility with single-project workflows
16. Validate integration with existing Sprint and Queue models

Architecture compliance confirmed - extending existing patterns rather than creating new files where possible.
## Implementation Notes

## ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Architectural Analysis Summary:
- **Compliance Verified**: All specifications align with ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003
- **Extension Strategy**: Builds upon existing models/capacity.py and services patterns
- **Integration Points**: Leverages Sprint.jira_project_key for project context
- **Backward Compatibility**: Confirmed - existing single-project workflows preserved

### Key Files for Implementation:
- **EXTEND**: /backend/app/models/capacity.py (add ProjectCapacityAllocation model)
- **CREATE**: /backend/app/services/capacity_service.py (new service following sprint_service.py patterns)
- **EXTEND**: /backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/capacity.py (add multi-project endpoints)

### Architecture Decision Rationale:
1. **Reuse Over Creation**: Extends existing DisciplineTeamCapacity model rather than replacing
2. **Project Context**: Uses existing Sprint.jira_project_key field for project identification  
3. **Service Patterns**: Follows established async SQLAlchemy service architecture
4. **API Consistency**: Maintains existing FastAPI router structure and patterns

### Implementation Priority:
1. **Phase 1**: Extend capacity.py model with ProjectCapacityAllocation
2. **Phase 2**: Create CapacityAnalysisService following existing service patterns
3. **Phase 3**: Extend capacity.py endpoints with multi-project APIs
4. **Phase 4**: Implement analytics algorithms and conflict detection
5. **Phase 5**: Add comprehensive testing following existing test patterns

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Low Risk**: Data model extensions follow proven patterns
- **Medium Risk**: Complex capacity algorithms require careful testing
- **Critical**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing capacity workflows

**READY FOR FULLSTACK-ENGINEER IMPLEMENTATION**
