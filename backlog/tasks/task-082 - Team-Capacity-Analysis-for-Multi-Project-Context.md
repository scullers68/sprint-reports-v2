## Description

Enhance capacity management system to analyze how single team capacity is distributed across multiple projects within meta-board sprints, providing insights for resource allocation optimization.

## Implementation Plan

## Architectural Specification for Multi-Project Capacity Analysis

### Phase 1: Data Model Extensions
1. Extend DisciplineTeamCapacity model to support project context
2. Create ProjectCapacityAllocation model for project-based allocation tracking
3. Add project-aware capacity planning relationships

### Phase 2: Service Layer Enhancements  
4. Extend existing capacity service patterns from models/capacity.py
5. Implement capacity distribution analysis algorithms
6. Create capacity forecasting service following existing service patterns

### Phase 3: API Layer Extensions
7. Extend existing capacity endpoints in api/v1/endpoints/capacity.py
8. Add project-based capacity reporting endpoints
9. Implement capacity optimization recommendation APIs

### Phase 4: Analytics & Reporting
10. Create capacity utilization analytics following existing report patterns
11. Implement historical capacity analysis
12. Add capacity conflict detection and resolution algorithms

### Phase 5: Integration & Compatibility
13. Ensure backward compatibility with single-project workflows
14. Integrate with existing Sprint and Queue models
15. Add comprehensive validation and error handling

### Architecture Compliance:
- Extends existing SQLAlchemy model patterns in /app/models/
- Follows current service architecture in /app/services/
- Builds upon existing FastAPI router structure
- Maintains ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003 compliance
- Preserves existing database relationships and constraints
