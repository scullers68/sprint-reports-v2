## Description

Implement automated build test and deployment pipeline with quality gates and security scanning

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Automated build and test pipeline configured
- [x] Code quality gates with SonarQube integration
- [x] Security scanning and vulnerability detection
- [x] Automated deployment to staging environment
- [x] Blue-green deployment strategy implemented

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing project structure and setup requirements
2. Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated build and testing
3. Integrate SonarQube for code quality gates
4. Add security scanning with Snyk or similar
5. Configure staging deployment automation
6. Implement blue-green deployment strategy
7. Test entire pipeline end-to-end

## Implementation Notes

CI/CD Pipeline implementation completed successfully. All components integrated with existing Docker infrastructure:

**IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:**
✅ GitHub Actions workflow with automated build, test, and deployment pipeline
✅ Multi-stage Docker builds for production optimization
✅ SonarQube integration with code quality gates and coverage reporting
✅ Security scanning with Bandit, Safety, Snyk, and Trivy
✅ Automated staging deployment with health checks and smoke tests
✅ Blue-green deployment strategy with zero-downtime cutover
✅ Environment-specific configurations for dev/staging/production
✅ Comprehensive setup and deployment scripts

**KEY FILES CREATED:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
- `backend/Dockerfile` (extended with multi-stage builds)
- `backend/docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production configuration
- `backend/docker-compose.staging.yml` - Staging configuration
- `backend/docker-compose.sonar.yml` - SonarQube local setup
- `scripts/deploy-staging.sh` - Automated staging deployment
- `scripts/deploy-blue-green.sh` - Blue-green deployment implementation
- `scripts/cutover-blue-green.sh` - Traffic cutover automation
- `scripts/setup-cicd.sh` - Complete pipeline setup
- Security configs: `.bandit`, `.snyk`, `sonar-project.properties`
- Environment templates: `.env.example`

**INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING CODEBASE:**
- Extended existing `requirements.txt` with security scanning tools
- Leveraged existing Docker infrastructure and compose patterns
- Integrated with existing FastAPI health endpoints (`/health`)
- Used existing test structure and quality tools (pytest, black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- Maintained compatibility with existing development workflow

**QUALITY GATES ENFORCED:**
- Code coverage minimum 80%
- All linting and formatting checks must pass
- Security vulnerability scanning (high severity threshold)
- Docker image security scanning
- SonarQube quality gate compliance

**DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW:**
1. Local development → Docker build → CI tests
2. Staging deployment → User acceptance → Production deployment
3. Blue-green production deployment with rollback capability

Ready for test-engineer validation and UAT deployment.
