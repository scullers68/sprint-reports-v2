## Description

Create flexible field mapping system allowing custom field mappings and transformations between JIRA and Sprint Reports

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Dynamic field mapping configuration interface
- [x] Support for custom field types and transformations
- [x] Field validation and type conversion
- [x] Mapping templates for common configurations
- [x] Field mapping migration and versioning

## Implementation Plan

Completed implementation with:
1. Analyzed existing JIRA service and integration patterns
2. Extended existing services with field mapping capabilities
3. Built mapping configuration system
4. Implemented validation and transformation logic
5. Created template system for common mappings

## Implementation Notes

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/Users/russellgrocott/Projects/sprint-reports-v2/backend/app/models/field_mapping.py` - New field mapping models
- `/Users/russellgrocott/Projects/sprint-reports-v2/backend/app/schemas/field_mapping.py` - New field mapping schemas
- `/Users/russellgrocott/Projects/sprint-reports-v2/backend/app/services/field_mapping_service.py` - New field mapping service
- `/Users/russellgrocott/Projects/sprint-reports-v2/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/field_mappings.py` - New API endpoints
- `/Users/russellgrocott/Projects/sprint-reports-v2/backend/alembic/versions/004_add_field_mapping_tables.py` - Database migration
- Extended `/Users/russellgrocott/Projects/sprint-reports-v2/backend/app/services/jira_service.py` with mapping capabilities
- Extended `/Users/russellgrocott/Projects/sprint-reports-v2/backend/app/services/sprint_service.py` with dynamic mapping support
- Updated model and schema imports in respective `__init__.py` files
- Updated API router to include field mapping endpoints

**Key Features Implemented:**
1. **Dynamic Field Mapping Models**: FieldMapping, FieldMappingTemplate, FieldMappingVersion with relationships
2. **Comprehensive Schemas**: Full CRUD schemas with validation for all field mapping operations
3. **Advanced Service Layer**: FieldMappingService with transformation, validation, and template support
4. **Extended JIRA Integration**: JiraService now supports dynamic field mapping with discovery capabilities
5. **Enhanced Sprint Analysis**: SprintService uses dynamic mappings with fallback to hardcoded fields
6. **Database Migration**: Complete migration script for field mapping tables with proper indexes
7. **RESTful API**: Full CRUD API endpoints for field mappings and templates
8. **Field Discovery**: Automatic JIRA field discovery and mapping suggestions
9. **Transformation Engine**: Support for multiple transformation types (direct, extract_object_value, string_format, numeric_conversion, date_format, conditional)
10. **Validation System**: Comprehensive field validation with type checking, range validation, pattern matching

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All existing functionality remains intact with hardcoded field mappings as fallback
- SprintService analyze_sprint method maintains existing behavior when no field mapping template is provided
- JiraService provides both raw and mapped data access methods

**Testing Instructions for test-engineer:**
1. Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply database migration
2. Test field mapping CRUD operations via API endpoints at `/api/v1/field-mappings/`
3. Test JIRA field discovery at `/api/v1/field-mappings/jira/discover`
4. Test field transformation and validation endpoints
5. Test sprint analysis with field mapping template integration
6. Verify backward compatibility with existing sprint analysis without field mappings

**Deployment Requirements:**
- Database migration must be applied: `alembic upgrade head`
- No environment variable changes required
- All new dependencies are already in existing requirements.txt

Implementation complete. Code ready for test-engineer validation.
