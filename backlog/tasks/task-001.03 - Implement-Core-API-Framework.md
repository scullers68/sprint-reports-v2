## Description

Build foundational API framework with routing middleware error handling and OpenAPI documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] API framework with routing middleware implemented
- [x] Error handling and logging middleware configured
- [x] OpenAPI 3.0 specification setup
- [x] Health check endpoints implemented
- [x] Request/response validation framework established

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing codebase structure and patterns
2. Implement core API routing framework with Express.js/FastAPI
3. Configure error handling and logging middleware
4. Set up OpenAPI 3.0 specification with Swagger documentation
5. Implement health check endpoints (/health, /ready)
6. Establish request/response validation framework
7. Test all endpoints and middleware functionality

## Implementation Notes

Core API Framework implementation completed successfully. All acceptance criteria met.

### Components Implemented:

**1. Error Handling & Exception Middleware**
- Created `/backend/app/core/middleware.py` with ErrorHandlingMiddleware
- Handles SQLAlchemy errors, ValueError validation errors, and unhandled exceptions
- Returns structured JSON error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

**2. Structured Logging Middleware**
- Implemented RequestLoggingMiddleware with correlation ID tracking
- Added structured JSON logging with `structlog` integration
- Created `/backend/app/core/logging.py` with centralized logging configuration

**3. Security Headers Middleware**
- Implemented SecurityHeadersMiddleware adding security headers to all responses

**4. Enhanced OpenAPI Documentation**
- Extended main.py with comprehensive API description and Bearer token authentication
- Added security scheme configuration and organized endpoints with descriptive tags

**5. Health Check Endpoints**
- Enhanced existing `/health` endpoint with structured response
- Added `/health/ready` endpoint with database connectivity validation
- Added `/health/live` endpoint for container orchestration

**6. Request/Response Validation Framework**
- Created `/backend/app/core/validation.py` with comprehensive validation utilities
- RequestValidator and ResponseValidator classes with Pydantic integration

### Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite at `/backend/test_core_framework.py`
- All components tested and verified working correctly
- Ready for production deployment
