## Description

Implement JIRA project and board discovery functionality that allows users to browse and select JIRA projects and boards for sprint analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fetch and display available JIRA projects
- [ ] Retrieve boards associated with projects
- [ ] Filter and search projects/boards
- [ ] Board type detection (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
- [ ] User permission validation for projects/boards
- [ ] Caching for performance optimization

## Implementation Plan

1. **Project Discovery API** - Fetch accessible JIRA projects
2. **Board Discovery API** - Retrieve boards for selected projects
3. **Permission Validation** - Check user access to projects/boards
4. **Filtering and Search** - Allow users to find specific projects/boards
5. **Caching Layer** - Optimize repeated requests

## Technical Notes

- Use JQL queries for advanced filtering
- Implement pagination for large project lists
- Cache project/board metadata for 1 hour
- Support both classic and next-gen projects
