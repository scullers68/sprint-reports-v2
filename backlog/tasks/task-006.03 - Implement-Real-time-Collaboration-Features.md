## OBSOLETE NOTICE

**This task is obsolete due to revised scope alignment with read-only analytics platform.**

**Reason**: Sprint Reports v2 is a read-only analytics platform. Users view and export reports, but don't collaboratively edit JIRA data (since the platform doesn't modify JIRA).

## Description

~~Build multi-user editing capabilities with conflict resolution and real-time synchronization~~

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multi-user editing with conflict resolution
- [ ] Real-time cursor and selection tracking
- [ ] Collaborative commenting and annotations
- [ ] User presence indicators
- [ ] Operational transformation for concurrent edits
