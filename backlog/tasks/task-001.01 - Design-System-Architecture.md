## Description

Create comprehensive architecture design following microservices principles and cloud-native patterns as specified in PRD

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) created for major technology choices
- [x] System architecture diagrams completed
- [x] Service boundaries and API contracts defined
- [x] Security architecture designed
- [x] Performance and scalability requirements documented

## Implementation Plan

## Implementation Plan for System Architecture Design

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Analyze PRD architecture principles (microservices, event-driven, cloud-native)
- Review existing codebase structure and identify reusable components
- Extract technical requirements from PRD for architecture design

### 2. Architecture Foundation
- Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major technology choices
- Design system architecture diagrams showing service boundaries
- Define API contracts and service interfaces
- Document security architecture with zero-trust principles

### 3. Service Design
- Define microservice boundaries based on domain-driven design
- Specify API contracts for each service using OpenAPI 3.0
- Design event-driven communication patterns
- Plan data persistence strategies per service

### 4. Security & Performance Architecture
- Design security architecture with authentication/authorization
- Define performance and scalability requirements
- Plan monitoring and observability architecture
- Design deployment and infrastructure patterns

### 5. Documentation & Validation
- Create comprehensive system architecture documentation
- Validate architecture against PRD requirements
- Document migration strategy from existing monolith
- Prepare handoff documentation for implementation team

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Design Complete
Successfully designed comprehensive system architecture following microservices principles and cloud-native patterns as specified in PRD. All designs extend existing FastAPI codebase structure rather than creating new components.

### Deliverables Created
1. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: 3 comprehensive ADRs covering microservices, database, and API design decisions
2. **System Architecture Documentation**: Complete system overview with service boundaries and integration patterns
3. **Security Architecture**: Comprehensive security design extending existing auth patterns
4. **Performance & Scalability Requirements**: Detailed performance targets and scaling strategies
5. **Architecture Index**: Complete documentation index with implementation guidance

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Microservices Pattern**: Extends existing FastAPI router structure
- **Database Architecture**: PostgreSQL adoption preserving existing SQLAlchemy models
- **Service Layer**: New services following existing patterns in jira_service.py
- **Security Enhancement**: Builds upon existing auth patterns
- **Configuration Extension**: Follows existing Pydantic patterns
