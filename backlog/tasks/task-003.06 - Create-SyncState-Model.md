## Description

Create the missing SyncState model as specified in the architecture. Currently the sync functionality may be compromised due to missing proper sync state tracking model that matches the architectural specification.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create SyncState model at app/models/sync_state.py with exact schema from architectural specification
- [ ] Include all required fields: resource_type resource_id jira_resource_id last_sync_at sync_status sync_direction conflicts resolution_strategy sync_duration_ms api_calls_count
- [ ] Add proper relationships and foreign keys to existing models
- [ ] Create database migration for sync_states table
- [ ] Add proper indexes for performance optimization
- [ ] Update sync service to use new SyncState model
