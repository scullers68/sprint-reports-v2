3. Extend existing /backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/jira.py with configuration endpoints
4. Implement CRUD operations: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for configurations 
5. Add comprehensive error handling and authentication checks
6. Update main API router to include new configuration endpoints
7. Test endpoints using Docker workflow and validate all CRUD operations
