## OBSOLETE NOTICE

**This task is obsolete due to revised scope alignment with read-only analytics platform.**

**Reason**: Webhook processing is not needed for read-only analytics platform. Periodic data refresh is sufficient.

## Description

~~Create the missing WebhookEvent model that is referenced by webhook endpoints but doesn't exist. This model is critical for webhook processing functionality and currently causes runtime errors when webhook endpoints try to import app.models.queue.WebhookEvent.~~

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create WebhookEvent model at app/models/webhook_event.py with exact schema from architectural specification
- [ ] Add proper imports and relationships to existing models
- [ ] Include all required fields: event_id event_type payload processed_at processing_status retry_count error_message processing_duration_ms
- [ ] Update webhook endpoints to use correct model import path
- [ ] Create database migration for webhook_events table
- [ ] Add proper indexes and constraints as specified in architecture
