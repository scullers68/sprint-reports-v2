## Description

Complete RBAC implementation by adding missing permission checks identified in architectural audit. Critical security vulnerability exists where permission checking is not fully implemented across API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add permission decorators to all API endpoints in /backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/
- [ ] Implement role-based access control middleware in /backend/app/core/middleware.py
- [ ] Add permission validation in service layer for all business operations
- [ ] Create admin interface components for role management
- [ ] Add audit logging for all permission changes and access attempts
- [ ] Test all authorization flows with unit and integration tests
- [ ] Implement resource-level permissions for sprints
- [ ] queues
- [ ] and reports
- [ ] Add permission inheritance for hierarchical roles
- [ ] Create permission matrix documentation
- [ ] Validate RBAC implementation against security architecture requirements
