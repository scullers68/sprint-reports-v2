## Description

Implement JIRA connection setup, authentication, and validation system to establish secure communication with JIRA Cloud/Server instances for data retrieval.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] JIRA Cloud and Server connection support
- [x] API token and OAuth 2.0 authentication
- [x] Connection testing and validation endpoints
- [x] Secure credential storage and encryption
- [x] Connection health monitoring and alerts
- [x] Error handling for invalid credentials
- [x] Support for custom JIRA domains
- [x] Connection status dashboard display

## Implementation Plan

1. Create JIRA connection endpoint for testing and validation
2. Implement connection setup API with support for both Cloud and Server
3. Add secure credential storage and encryption integration
4. Create connection health monitoring endpoint
5. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
6. Add connection status dashboard API endpoints
7. Create frontend components for connection setup and status display
8. Implement comprehensive connection validation and testing

## Implementation Notes

**Implementation completed successfully. Ready for test-engineer validation.**

### Backend Implementation
- Created comprehensive JIRA connection endpoints in `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/jira.py`
- Implemented JIRA connection testing, setup, status monitoring, health checks, and capabilities discovery
- Added Pydantic schemas in `/backend/app/schemas/jira.py` for type-safe request/response handling
- Integrated with existing encryption service for secure credential storage
- Added proper authentication via existing security middleware
- Extended existing JIRA service with new connection validation features

### Frontend Implementation
- Created JIRA connection management page at `/frontend/src/app/jira/page.tsx`
- Implemented tabbed interface for connection status, setup, and health monitoring
- Added real-time connection testing and validation
- Integrated with backend API endpoints for full functionality
- Follows existing authentication patterns and UI design

### Endpoints Implemented
- `POST /api/v1/jira/connection/test` - Test JIRA connection with credentials
- `POST /api/v1/jira/connection/setup` - Configure and store JIRA connection
- `GET /api/v1/jira/connection/status` - Get current connection status and capabilities
- `GET /api/v1/jira/connection/health` - Comprehensive health monitoring
- `GET /api/v1/jira/connection/capabilities` - Discover available JIRA features

### Quality Validation Results
- Docker containers build and run successfully
- Backend API endpoints accessible and protected with authentication
- Frontend ESLint validation passes with 0 errors
- All quality gates passed
- No commit bypassing required (--no-verify not used)

### Technical Notes
- Built on existing Sprint Reports v2 architecture
- Follows read-only analytics platform vision from revised PRD
- Integrates with existing authentication, encryption, and database systems
- Supports both JIRA Cloud and Server with auto-detection
- Includes comprehensive error handling and user feedback
