## Description

Complete SSO provider configuration that was identified as missing during architectural audit. This is production-blocking as SSO providers are not configured in config.py, preventing proper authentication flows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add Google OAuth2 provider configuration with client ID and secret
- [ ] Add Microsoft Azure AD provider configuration with tenant and application settings
- [ ] Add SAML provider configuration with metadata and certificate handling
- [ ] Update authentication flows in /backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py to support SSO providers
- [ ] Add SSO callback endpoints for each provider
- [ ] Configure OAuth2 client credentials and redirect URIs
- [ ] Add SSO provider selection UI components
- [ ] Test SSO authentication flow end-to-end for each provider
- [ ] Update configuration documentation with SSO setup instructions
- [ ] Validate SSO configuration against security requirements in ADR-003

## Implementation Plan

## ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS COMPLETE

### Current State Assessment:
1. **Configuration Gap**: SSO provider settings missing from config.py
2. **Authentication Flow**: Existing auth.py has SSO endpoints but references missing config settings
3. **Service Layer**: AuthenticationService exists but lacks provider-specific configurations
4. **Frontend**: No frontend components exist (empty frontend directory)

### Architectural Decisions:
1. **Extend Existing Patterns**: Build upon current FastAPI router and service architecture per ADR-001
2. **Configuration-First Approach**: Add SSO provider configs to existing config.py following Pydantic Settings pattern
3. **Service Layer Extension**: Enhance existing AuthenticationService with provider-specific methods
4. **Frontend Component Creation**: Create React SSO selection and callback components
5. **Security Compliance**: Implement per ADR-003 security requirements

### Implementation Approach:
1. Add Google OAuth2, Azure AD, and SAML provider configurations to config.py
2. Update authentication service with provider-specific initialization methods
3. Enhance auth.py endpoints with proper provider routing
4. Create frontend SSO provider selection UI
5. Implement callback handling for each provider
6. Add comprehensive testing and validation

### Integration Points:
- Existing User model (with SSO fields already present)
- Current AuthenticationService class
- FastAPI router structure in auth.py
- Pydantic Settings configuration pattern

### Risk Assessment:
- LOW: Configuration changes (isolated to config.py)
- MEDIUM: Service layer enhancements (well-defined interfaces)
- HIGH: Frontend creation (new components required)

Ready for fullstack-engineer implementation handoff.

## Implementation Notes

ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE: SSO implementation specifications documented. Key requirements: 1) Extend config.py with Google/Azure/SAML settings, 2) Enhance AuthenticationService with provider methods, 3) Update auth.py endpoints, 4) Create frontend SSO components. All patterns follow ADR compliance. Google credentials provided. Ready for fullstack-engineer implementation.
