## Description

Implement JIRA connection setup and validation functionality that allows users to configure and test their JIRA instance connections for sprint data import.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] JIRA connection configuration interface (backend API)
- [ ] JIRA instance validation and testing
- [ ] Support for JIRA Cloud and Server instances
- [ ] Connection status monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Secure credential storage and management
- [ ] Error handling for common connection issues

## Implementation Plan

1. **Extend Authentication Service** - Add JIRA credential management
2. **Create Connection Validator** - Test JIRA connectivity and permissions
3. **Add Health Check Endpoints** - Monitor JIRA connection status
4. **Implement Credential Encryption** - Secure storage of JIRA tokens
5. **Add Connection Management API** - CRUD operations for JIRA connections

## Technical Notes

- Build on existing JiraService from task-003.01
- Use existing authentication patterns and security infrastructure
- Support multiple JIRA instances per organization
- Implement connection pooling and caching
