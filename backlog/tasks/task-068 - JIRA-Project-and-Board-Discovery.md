## Description

Build project and board discovery interface allowing users to browse, filter, and select JIRA projects and boards for sprint data import.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Browse all accessible JIRA projects
- [ ] Display project permissions and access levels
- [ ] Filter projects by name and key
- [ ] Discover boards within selected projects
- [ ] Board type detection (Scrum Kanban)
- [ ] Board configuration and sprint settings display
- [ ] Project selection persistence
- [ ] Permission validation before board access

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing JIRA integration code in backend/app/services/jira_service.py
2. Review current frontend structure for UI patterns
3. Design JIRA project and board discovery API endpoints
4. Implement backend API for project/board discovery with filtering
5. Create frontend components for project/board browsing interface
6. Add permission validation and error handling
7. Implement project selection persistence
8. Test integration with JIRA API and validate functionality

## Implementation Notes

Implementation complete. JIRA project and board discovery functionality successfully implemented:

## Backend Implementation
- Extended /backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/jira.py with 4 new endpoints:
  - GET /api/v1/jira/projects - Browse all accessible JIRA projects with filtering
  - GET /api/v1/jira/projects/{project_key}/boards - Discover boards within projects
  - GET /api/v1/jira/boards/{board_id}/configuration - Get board configuration details
  - POST /api/v1/jira/projects/{project_key}/select - Select project and boards for import

## Frontend Implementation  
- Extended /frontend/src/app/jira/page.tsx with comprehensive project/board discovery UI
- Added project browsing with search functionality
- Implemented board selection with type filtering (Scrum/Kanban)
- Added selection confirmation and result display
- Integrated with existing API client in /frontend/src/lib/api.ts

## Features Implemented
✅ Browse all accessible JIRA projects
✅ Display project permissions and access levels  
✅ Filter projects by name and key
✅ Discover boards within selected projects
✅ Board type detection (Scrum/Kanban)
✅ Board configuration and sprint settings display
✅ Project selection persistence
✅ Permission validation before board access

## Testing Status
- Backend API loads successfully without errors
- Docker environment starts cleanly
- Authentication middleware working correctly
- Frontend compiles without errors
- All acceptance criteria implemented

Ready for manual testing with live JIRA connection.
