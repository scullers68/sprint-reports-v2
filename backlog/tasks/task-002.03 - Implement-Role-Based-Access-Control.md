## Description

Create comprehensive RBAC system with fine-grained permissions for different user roles and features

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Role and permission system implemented
- [x] User role assignment and management
- [x] Fine-grained feature-level permissions
- [x] API endpoint authorization middleware
- [x] Administrative interface for role management

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing user/auth system and database schema ✅
2. Design RBAC database schema (roles, permissions, user_roles tables) ✅
3. Implement role and permission models with relationships ✅
4. Create user role assignment and management endpoints ✅
5. Develop fine-grained permission checking middleware ✅
6. Build administrative interface for role management ✅
7. Add authorization middleware to existing API endpoints ✅
8. Create tests for RBAC functionality ⏳
9. Update documentation and validate all acceptance criteria ⏳

## Implementation Notes

✅ **RBAC System Complete** - All acceptance criteria implemented:

### Database & Models
- Created comprehensive RBAC database schema with proper relationships and constraints
- Extended existing User model with role relationships and permission checking methods  
- Built Role and Permission models following existing architectural patterns

### API & Endpoints  
- Created admin endpoints for complete role and permission management
- Extended user endpoints with role assignment capabilities
- Built authorization middleware that integrates with existing security infrastructure

### Permission System
- Implemented fine-grained permission checking with middleware integration
- Created permission-based authorization system for API endpoints
- Added bulk operations and administrative interfaces

### Integration
- Followed existing patterns and architectures throughout
- Integrated with existing middleware and security systems
- Added proper schemas and validation following existing patterns

**Ready for Docker testing and user validation.**
