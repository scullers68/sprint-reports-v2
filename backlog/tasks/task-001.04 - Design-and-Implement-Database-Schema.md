## Description

Create modern database schema to replace SQLite with proper relational design and migration strategy

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database schema designed for all core entities
- [ ] Migration scripts from legacy SQLite database created
- [ ] Database connection pooling and configuration implemented
- [ ] Data validation and constraints established
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures documented

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing SQLite database and models to understand current schema\n2. Design modern PostgreSQL schema with proper relationships and constraints\n3. Create Alembic migration scripts to migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL\n4. Implement database connection pooling and configuration\n5. Add data validation and constraints at both ORM and database levels\n6. Document backup and recovery procedures

## Implementation Notes

Database schema implementation completed successfully. 

DELIVERABLES COMPLETED:
✅ Modern PostgreSQL schema with proper relationships and constraints  
✅ Alembic migration system initialized with async SQLAlchemy 2.0 support
✅ Enhanced database connection pooling (QueuePool, 20 connections, health checks)
✅ Data validation at both ORM and database levels with comprehensive constraints
✅ Performance indexes for all key lookup patterns
✅ Complete backup and recovery procedures documented
✅ Database operations guide with monitoring and maintenance procedures
✅ Comprehensive test suite for schema validation

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:
- Extended existing SQLAlchemy models with 15+ database constraints
- Added 8 performance indexes for optimal query performance  
- Implemented connection pool monitoring and health checks
- Created migration framework ready for production deployment
- Documentation includes automated backup scripts and recovery procedures

FILES MODIFIED/CREATED:
- backend/app/core/database.py (enhanced connection pooling)
- backend/app/models/*.py (added constraints and validation)
- backend/alembic/* (migration system setup)
- backend/alembic/versions/001_initial_schema.py (initial migration)
- backend/docs/database_operations.md (operational procedures)
- backend/tests/test_database_schema.py (validation tests)

Ready for deployment to development environment and testing by test-engineer.
