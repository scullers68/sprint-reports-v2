title: Enhanced JIRA Integration for Meta-Board Support
status: In Progress
assignee:
  - >-
    [ ] Enhance existing JiraService to detect project sources for issues in
    meta-board contexts, [ ] Implement project key extraction and validation for
    Board 259 task aggregation, [ ] Add specialized synchronization logic for
    meta-boards that preserves project source information, [ ] Create
    project-aware caching strategies for improved performance with multi-project
    data, [ ] Implement cross-project dependency tracking within meta-board
    context, [ ] Add project-specific field mapping support for heterogeneous
    project configurations, [ ] Enhance error handling for project-specific JIRA
    API failures in meta-board scenarios, [ ] Ensure existing single-board JIRA
    integration remains fully functional and unaffected

## Description

Extend existing JIRA integration to properly handle meta-board scenarios, including project source detection, cross-project issue tracking, and specialized synchronization for Board 259 aggregation patterns.

## Implementation Plan

1. Requirements Analysis: Analyze task-083 for enhanced JIRA integration supporting meta-board scenarios\n2. Architecture Design: Design meta-board aware JIRA service extensions for Board 259 aggregation\n3. Technical Specification: Specify project detection, cross-project tracking, and specialized sync logic\n4. Implementation Handoff: Create detailed handoff notes for fullstack-engineer implementation\n5. Architecture Review: Remain available for clarification during implementation phase

## Implementation Notes

ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION COMPLETE - Enhanced JIRA Integration for Meta-Board Support. All specifications follow ADR compliance and prioritize code reuse. Extensions build upon existing JiraService patterns for Board 259 aggregation, project source detection, cross-project tracking, and specialized synchronization. Ready for fullstack-engineer implementation.
