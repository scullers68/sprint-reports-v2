## Description

Extend existing JIRA integration to properly handle meta-board scenarios, including project source detection, cross-project issue tracking, and specialized synchronization for Board 259 aggregation patterns.

## Implementation Plan

1. Requirements Analysis: Analyze task-083 for enhanced JIRA integration supporting meta-board scenarios\n2. Architecture Design: Design meta-board aware JIRA service extensions for Board 259 aggregation\n3. Technical Specification: Specify project detection, cross-project tracking, and specialized sync logic\n4. Implementation Handoff: Create detailed handoff notes for fullstack-engineer implementation\n5. Architecture Review: Remain available for clarification during implementation phase


## Implementation Notes

Architecture complete. Ready for fullstack-engineer implementation. Enhanced JIRA integration specification follows ADR compliance with extensions to existing JiraService for Board 259 meta-board support, project source detection, cross-project tracking, and specialized synchronization patterns.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Enhance existing JiraService to detect project sources for issues in meta-board contexts
- [ ] Implement project key extraction and validation for Board 259 task aggregation
- [ ] Add specialized synchronization logic for meta-boards that preserves project source information
- [ ] Create project-aware caching strategies for improved performance with multi-project data
- [ ] Implement cross-project dependency tracking within meta-board context
- [ ] Add project-specific field mapping support for heterogeneous project configurations
- [ ] Enhance error handling for project-specific JIRA API failures in meta-board scenarios
- [ ] Ensure existing single-board JIRA integration remains fully functional and unaffected

## ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION COMPLETE

### System Architecture Analysis
✅ **COMPLIANCE VALIDATED**: All specifications align with ADR-001 (Microservices), ADR-002 (Database), and ADR-003 (API Design)
✅ **PATTERN ANALYSIS**: Identified extension points in existing JiraService and JIRA endpoints
✅ **REUSE PRIORITIZED**: Extensions build upon existing patterns, minimal new code required

### Implementation Handoff for Fullstack-Engineer

#### Critical Files to Extend (NO NEW FILES REQUIRED):

1. **Primary Extension: `/backend/app/services/jira_service.py`**
   - Add project source detection methods after line 1020
   - Add enhanced sprint issues method with project tracking after line 492
   - Add meta-board synchronization logic after line 920
   - Add project-aware caching methods after line 340
   - Add Board 259 specific detection logic

2. **Secondary Extension: `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/jira.py`**
   - Add meta-board analysis endpoints after line 1465
   - Add Board 259 specific endpoints for aggregation patterns

#### Key Method Extensions Required:

**JiraService Extensions:**
```python
# Project Detection Methods
async def detect_project_sources_for_board(self, board_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]
async def get_board_project_distribution(self, board_id: int) -> Dict[str, int]
async def is_meta_board(self, board_id: int, threshold: int = 2) -> bool

# Enhanced Issue Retrieval
async def get_sprint_issues_with_project_tracking(self, sprint_id: int, track_cross_project_deps: bool = True, cache_strategy: str = 'project_aware') -> List[Dict[str, Any]]

# Meta-Board Synchronization
async def sync_meta_board_sprint(self, sprint_id: int, board_id: int, preserve_project_source: bool = True) -> Dict[str, Any]
async def validate_meta_board_consistency(self, board_id: int, expected_projects: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Board 259 Specific
async def is_board_259_meta_board(self, board_id: int) -> bool
BOARD_259_ID = 259  # Constant for Board 259 logic
```

**API Endpoint Extensions:**
```python
@router.get('/boards/{board_id}/meta-board-analysis')
@router.get('/boards/{board_id}/project-distribution') 
@router.post('/boards/{board_id}/enable-meta-board')
```

#### Integration Points:
- Extends existing JiraService class architecture
- Maintains current authentication and error handling patterns
- Integrates with existing caching mechanisms
- Preserves backward compatibility with single-board operations

#### Implementation Priorities:
1. **HIGH**: Project source detection for Board 259
2. **HIGH**: Enhanced sync logic with project preservation
3. **MEDIUM**: Cross-project dependency tracking
4. **MEDIUM**: Project-aware caching strategies
5. **LOW**: API endpoints for meta-board configuration

#### Risk Mitigation:
- All changes are additive extensions only
- Existing JiraService methods remain unchanged
- Backward compatibility maintained through optional parameters
- Board 259 logic isolated in specific methods

#### Validation Requirements:
- Test Board 259 detection accuracy
- Verify project source preservation in sync operations
- Confirm cross-project dependency tracking
- Validate performance with project-aware caching
- Ensure no regression in existing single-board functionality
