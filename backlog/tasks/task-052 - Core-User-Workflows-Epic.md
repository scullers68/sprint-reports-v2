## Description

Implement end-to-end user workflows for sprint management and data display within Days 8-14. Focus on delivering core business value through complete, testable user journeys from authentication to data manipulation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete authentication flow working end-to-end
- [ ] Sprint data display with real backend data
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations for sprints
- [ ] User profile management working
- [ ] Dashboard showing meaningful data
- [ ] Data persistence across sessions
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Mobile-responsive interface

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Display (Days 8-10)
1. **Sprint List Interface** (Task 052.01)
   - Display sprints from backend API
   - Implement pagination and filtering
   - Add search functionality

2. **Sprint Detail View** (Task 052.02)
   - Individual sprint pages
   - Sprint metrics and analytics
   - Issue breakdown and progress

3. **Dashboard Analytics** (Task 052.03)
   - Sprint progress overview
   - Team performance metrics
   - Quick action buttons

### Phase 2: Data Management (Days 11-13)
4. **Sprint CRUD Operations** (Task 052.04)
   - Create new sprints
   - Edit existing sprints
   - Archive/delete sprints

5. **User Management** (Task 052.05)
   - User profile editing
   - Team member management
   - Role-based permissions

### Phase 3: User Experience (Day 14)
6. **Workflow Integration** (Task 052.06)
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance optimization
   - User experience polish

## Success Metrics

- User can complete sprint creation in <2 minutes
- Sprint data loads and displays within 3 seconds
- All CRUD operations work without errors
- Users can navigate between features seamlessly
- Data persists correctly across sessions
- Error messages are clear and actionable

## Key User Journeys

### Primary Journey: Sprint Management
1. **Login** → Dashboard
2. **View Sprints** → Sprint list with filtering
3. **Create Sprint** → Form with validation
4. **Edit Sprint** → Update sprint details
5. **View Analytics** → Sprint progress and metrics

### Secondary Journey: User Management
1. **Profile View** → Current user information
2. **Edit Profile** → Update user details
3. **Team Management** → View and manage team members
4. **Role Management** → Assign roles and permissions

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Pages**: Dashboard, Sprint List, Sprint Detail, Profile
- **Forms**: Sprint creation/editing, User profile
- **Charts**: Progress visualization, Analytics
- **Tables**: Data display with sorting/filtering

### Backend Integration
- **APIs**: Sprint CRUD, User management, Analytics
- **Real-time**: Live updates for collaborative features
- **Caching**: Optimized data loading
- **Validation**: Form and data validation

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Integration**: Mock data fallbacks for development
- **Performance**: Pagination and lazy loading
- **Data Integrity**: Client-side and server-side validation
- **User Experience**: Clear loading states and error messages

## Implementation Notes

**Priority**: Complete user workflows over individual features
**Testing Strategy**: Focus on end-to-end user journeys
**Data Strategy**: Use real backend data with fallbacks
**Performance**: Optimize after core functionality works

This epic coordinates all workflow subtasks (052.01-052.06) and ensures users can accomplish their primary goals.
