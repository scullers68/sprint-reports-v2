## Description

Build core authentication system with support for multiple authentication providers and secure session management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] User registration and login functionality implemented
- [x] Password hashing and security best practices applied
- [x] Session management with secure tokens
- [x] Password reset and recovery functionality
- [x] Account lockout and security policies

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing authentication infrastructure and FastAPI patterns
2. Extend existing user model and auth endpoints with comprehensive authentication
3. Implement secure password hashing, session management, and token handling
4. Add password reset/recovery functionality using existing patterns
5. Implement account lockout and security policies
6. Add comprehensive testing and validation
7. Document implementation and integration points

## Implementation Notes

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - ALL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET**

### Architecture Summary
- Extended existing User model with authentication fields (failed_login_attempts, locked_until, last_login, reset_token, reset_token_expires)
- Created AuthService following existing service patterns from sprint_service.py
- Added comprehensive security utilities with JWT tokens and password hashing
- Implemented full authentication endpoints replacing placeholder implementations
- Added user management endpoints with role-based access control

### Security Features Implemented
- Bcrypt password hashing with security best practices
- JWT access tokens (30min expiry) and refresh tokens (7 days expiry) 
- Failed login tracking with automatic account lockout after 5 attempts (30min lockout)
- Password strength validation (8+ chars, mixed case, digits required)
- Secure password reset with 1-hour token expiry
- Protection against email enumeration attacks
- Role-based access control (superuser vs regular user permissions)

### Files Modified/Created
**Extended Existing Files:**
- backend/app/models/user.py: Added authentication fields and security methods
- backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py: Full implementation replacing placeholders
- backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/users.py: Complete user management endpoints

**New Files Following Existing Patterns:**
- backend/app/schemas/auth.py: Authentication schemas following sprint.py patterns
- backend/app/services/auth_service.py: Service layer following sprint_service.py patterns
- backend/app/core/security.py: Security utilities and dependencies
- backend/alembic/versions/002_add_user_auth_fields.py: Database migration
- backend/tests/test_authentication.py: Comprehensive test suite

### Ready for Next Phase
Code ready for Docker testing and validation by test-engineer. All authentication functionality implemented with production-ready security practices.
