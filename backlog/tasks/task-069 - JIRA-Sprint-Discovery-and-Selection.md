## Description

Implement sprint discovery and selection system to fetch, filter, and select sprints from JIRA boards for data import and analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fetch all sprints from selected boards
- [ ] Sprint filtering by status (active closed future)
- [ ] Date range filtering for sprint selection
- [ ] Sprint search by name and description
- [ ] Bulk sprint selection capabilities
- [ ] Sprint metadata preview (dates goals team)
- [ ] Selected sprint persistence across sessions
- [ ] Sprint selection validation and confirmation

## Implementation Plan

COMPLIANCE CONFIRMED: I will prioritize reuse over creation

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1. Analyze existing JIRA integration code and components
2. Extend existing API endpoints for sprint discovery functionality
3. Enhance frontend components for sprint filtering and selection
4. Implement sprint persistence using existing state management
5. Add validation and confirmation using existing patterns
6. Leverage existing bulk selection capabilities where available
7. Test integration with existing JIRA workflow
