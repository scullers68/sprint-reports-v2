## Description

Enhance data models to support project-based organization of tasks within sprints, enabling tracking and reporting on multiple project workstreams within a single sprint context.

## Implementation Plan

ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS AND DESIGN PLAN

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
1. Analyze task-079 acceptance criteria for project-based organization requirements
2. Review existing Sprint, SprintAnalysis, and related model structures
3. Identify extension points in current data model architecture
4. Map requirements to database schema changes and new model relationships

## Phase 2: Data Model Design  
1. Design ProjectWorkstream model for project source representation within meta-board sprints
2. Design project_workstreams relationship extension to Sprint model
3. Design project_key/project_name field additions to SprintAnalysis and related models
4. Design ProjectSprintMetrics model for project-level metrics tracking
5. Design database relationships between Sprint, ProjectWorkstream, and SprintAnalysis
6. Design efficient indexes for project-based queries and reporting

## Phase 3: Database Architecture Specification
1. Create detailed model specifications following existing Base model patterns
2. Specify foreign key relationships and cascade behaviors
3. Specify validation constraints and business rules
4. Create index specifications for optimal query performance
5. Design migration scripts to populate project data from existing records

## Phase 4: Implementation Specification
1. Document specific files to extend (following ADR-002 database patterns)
2. Create detailed migration strategy preserving existing data
3. Specify validation rules ensuring data integrity across relationships
4. Document integration points with existing Sprint and analysis workflows

## Phase 5: Handoff Documentation
1. Create comprehensive architectural specification for fullstack-engineer
2. Provide migration strategy and data preservation approach
3. Document validation and constraint requirements
4. Specify testing approach for new relationships and queries
