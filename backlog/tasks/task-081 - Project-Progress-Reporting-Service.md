## Description

Build comprehensive project progress reporting service that provides detailed breakdown of progress by project within sprint context, including velocity tracking and completion predictions.

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing reporting service architecture and project data models
2. Design project progress reporting service extending existing Report and SprintAnalysis models
3. Specify project velocity calculation algorithms using historical sprint data patterns
4. Design Monte Carlo simulation methods for project completion forecasting
5. Architect project-level burndown/burnup chart data generation
6. Design project dependency tracking and impact analysis service methods
7. Specify project risk assessment based on velocity trends and capacity constraints
8. Design project milestone tracking within sprint context
9. Create comprehensive technical specification for fullstack-engineer handoff
