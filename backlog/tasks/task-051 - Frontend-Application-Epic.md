## Description

Create minimal Next.js frontend application with authentication interface and basic navigation. Focus on delivering a working, testable user interface within Days 4-7 that connects to the backend API.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Next.js application created and running
- [ ] Login page with username/password authentication
- [ ] Dashboard page with navigation menu
- [ ] Sprint list page showing real data
- [ ] User profile page with basic info
- [ ] Responsive design working on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Authentication state management working
- [ ] API integration with backend

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Application Foundation (Day 4)
1. **Next.js Setup** (Task 051.01)
   - Create Next.js application with TypeScript
   - Configure basic routing and layouts
   - Set up API client for backend integration

2. **Authentication UI** (Task 051.02)
   - Create login page with form validation
   - Implement JWT token management
   - Add protected route wrapper

### Phase 2: Core Pages (Day 5-6)
3. **Dashboard Interface** (Task 051.03)
   - Create main dashboard layout
   - Add navigation menu
   - Display user info and quick stats

4. **Sprint Management UI** (Task 051.04)
   - Create sprint list page
   - Add sprint detail view
   - Implement basic sprint CRUD operations

### Phase 3: User Experience (Day 7)
5. **User Management UI** (Task 051.05)
   - Create user profile page
   - Add user list for admins
   - Implement user management features

6. **Polish and Testing** (Task 051.06)
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Implement responsive design
   - Add basic accessibility features

## Success Metrics

- User can login and access dashboard within 3 clicks
- Sprint data loads and displays within 2 seconds
- Application works on mobile and desktop browsers
- All forms have proper validation and error handling
- User can complete basic tasks without errors

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context + hooks
- **API Client**: Fetch API with custom hooks
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Integration Issues**: Create mock data fallbacks
- **Authentication Complexity**: Use simple JWT approach first
- **Design Time**: Use Tailwind UI components for speed
- **State Management**: Keep it simple with Context API

## Implementation Notes

**Priority**: Working functionality over perfect design
**Testing Strategy**: Manual testing focusing on user workflows
**Performance**: Optimize after core features work
**Documentation**: Focus on user-facing features

This epic coordinates all frontend subtasks (051.01-051.06) and ensures we have a complete user interface for testing.
