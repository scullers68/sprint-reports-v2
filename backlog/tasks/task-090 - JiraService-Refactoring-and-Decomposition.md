## Description

Refactor the monolithic 2,000-line JiraService into focused, maintainable services to support meta-board functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Split JiraService into JiraAPIClient (HTTP operations)
- [ ] JiraService (core CRUD)
- [ ] MetaBoardService (Board 259 logic)
- [ ] and JiraSyncService (synchronization)
- [ ] Extract common patterns and reduce code duplication across services
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints
- [ ] All existing tests pass after refactoring
- [ ] New service boundaries follow single responsibility principle
- [ ] Services are properly dependency-injected and testable

## Implementation Plan

1. Extract JiraAPIClient to separate module
2. Create core JiraService with basic CRUD operations (get_sprints, get_issues, get_boards, etc.)
3. Extract MetaBoardService for Board 259 logic and meta-board functionality
4. Create JiraSyncService for webhook processing and synchronization
5. Create JiraFieldMappingService for field mapping operations
6. Implement service composition pattern with dependency injection
7. Maintain backward compatibility facade in main JiraService
8. Validate all existing tests pass after refactoring
9. Ensure single responsibility principle across all services
