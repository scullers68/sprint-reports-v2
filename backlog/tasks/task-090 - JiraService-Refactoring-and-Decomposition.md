## Description

Refactor the monolithic 2,000-line JiraService into focused, maintainable services to support meta-board functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Split JiraService into JiraAPIClient (HTTP operations)
- [ ] JiraService (core CRUD)
- [ ] MetaBoardService (Board 259 logic)
- [ ] and JiraSyncService (synchronization)
- [ ] Extract common patterns and reduce code duplication across services
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints
- [ ] All existing tests pass after refactoring
- [ ] New service boundaries follow single responsibility principle
- [ ] Services are properly dependency-injected and testable
