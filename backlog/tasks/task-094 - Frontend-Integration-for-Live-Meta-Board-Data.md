## Description

Replace mock data in Board 259 frontend hooks with live API integration while maintaining existing UI behavior

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update usePortfolioData hook to call /api/v1/meta-boards/259/portfolio
- [ ] Update useProjectReportData hook to call meta-board project detail APIs
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and loading states for API failures
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms when APIs are unavailable
- [ ] Maintain existing data structure contracts to avoid breaking UI components
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed API calls with exponential backoff
- [ ] Preserve all existing UI functionality during transition from mock to live data
- [ ] Test with both successful API responses and error scenarios
