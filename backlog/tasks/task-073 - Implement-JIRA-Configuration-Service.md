## Description

Create service layer for managing JIRA configurations with CRUD operations, encryption and connection testing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add proper error handling and logging throughout service

## Implementation Plan

1. Create JiraConfigurationService class extending existing patterns from jira_service.py
2. Implement CRUD operations for JiraConfiguration model with proper encryption handling
3. Add connection testing and validation methods with comprehensive error handling
4. Add proper logging throughout all service methods
5. Create database session management and transaction handling
6. Add comprehensive error handling for database operations, validation, and JIRA API calls
7. Follow existing architectural patterns from system-architecture.md

## Implementation Notes

Implementation complete. Created JiraConfigurationService with comprehensive CRUD operations, encryption handling, connection testing, and proper error handling/logging throughout.

### Key Features Implemented:
- Full CRUD operations for JIRA configurations with database transaction management
- Automatic encryption/decryption of sensitive credentials using existing encryption service
- Connection testing and validation with comprehensive error tracking
- Database transaction management with proper rollback on errors
- Comprehensive logging at all levels (debug, info, warning, error) using get_logger
- Status monitoring and health checking capabilities
- Default configuration management per environment
- Follows existing architectural patterns from jira_service.py and system-architecture.md

### Error Handling Coverage:
- SQLAlchemy database errors with proper rollback and DatabaseError exceptions
- External service connection failures with ExternalServiceError exceptions
- Validation errors for invalid data with ValidationError exceptions
- Integrity constraint violations with meaningful error messages
- Unexpected errors with full stack traces and proper logging

### Files Created:
- `/backend/app/services/jira_configuration_service.py` - Complete service implementation

The service is ready for integration and follows all architectural requirements. Code quality validated with Python syntax compilation.
