## Description

Create comprehensive audit logging system for security events user actions and system changes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Audit logging framework implemented
- [x] Security event tracking and alerting
- [x] User action logging with tamper detection
- [x] Compliance reporting capabilities
- [x] Log retention and archival policies

## Implementation Notes

Implementation complete. Comprehensive security audit logging system implemented with:

**FILES MODIFIED/CREATED:**
- `/backend/app/models/security.py` - SecurityEvent and AuditLog models with tamper detection
- `/backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Added security model imports  
- `/backend/app/core/logging.py` - Extended with AuditLogger class and security event logging
- `/backend/app/core/middleware.py` - Added SecurityAuditMiddleware for comprehensive request auditing
- `/backend/app/core/config.py` - Added audit logging configuration settings
- `/backend/app/services/audit_service.py` - AuditService with tamper detection and compliance reporting
- `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/audit.py` - Complete audit management API endpoints
- `/backend/app/api/v1/router.py` - Added audit endpoints to main router
- `/backend/tests/test_audit_service.py` - Comprehensive audit service tests
- `/backend/tests/test_audit_middleware.py` - Security middleware tests

**FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTED:**
✅ Audit logging framework with structured logging and database persistence
✅ Security event tracking with authentication, authorization, and data access logging
✅ User action logging with tamper detection using SHA-256 checksums and chain integrity
✅ Compliance reporting for GDPR, SOC2, ISO27001 with configurable frameworks
✅ Log retention and archival policies with automated cleanup
✅ Suspicious activity detection (brute force, rate limiting, suspicious user agents)
✅ Comprehensive API endpoints for audit management and reporting
✅ Full test coverage for all components

**SECURITY FEATURES:**
- Tamper-proof audit logs with SHA-256 checksums
- Chain integrity verification for detecting breaks in audit trail
- Configurable retention policies for compliance requirements
- Real-time security event logging and alerting
- Support for multiple compliance frameworks
- Comprehensive middleware integration for automatic event capture

Ready for test-engineer validation. All acceptance criteria completed.

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing logging infrastructure and middleware\n2. Design audit logging framework with secure storage\n3. Implement security event tracking and user action logging\n4. Add tamper detection mechanisms for audit logs\n5. Create compliance reporting capabilities\n6. Implement log retention and archival policies\n7. Add comprehensive testing and validation
