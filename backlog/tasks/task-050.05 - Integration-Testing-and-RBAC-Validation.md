## Description

Comprehensive testing of fixed authentication system integration with existing RBAC system, user session management, and JWT token handling. Ensures the authentication fixes work properly with all existing Sprint Reports v2 infrastructure.

**DEPENDENCIES**: Requires completion of authentication method and endpoint fixes
**CRITICAL**: Validates that authentication system works with existing infrastructure before Epic 051.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Validate admin user authentication with existing credentials
- [x] Test JWT token generation, validation, and expiration handling
- [x] Verify user session management and token refresh functionality
- [x] Test authentication integration with existing RBAC permission system
- [x] Validate user role assignment during registration and login
- [x] Test authentication middleware and protected endpoint access
- [x] Verify audit logging captures authentication events properly
- [x] Test authentication failure scenarios and rate limiting
- [x] Validate SSO integration points remain functional

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Admin User Authentication Testing
- Test admin login with existing credentials (admin@sprint-reports.com / admin123)
- Verify admin receives proper JWT token with correct permissions
- Test admin access to protected endpoints using token
- Validate admin role and permission assignments

### Step 2: JWT Token System Validation
- Test token generation format and structure
- Verify token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Test token validation in middleware
- Ensure tokens contain required user identification data

### Step 3: RBAC System Integration
- Test role assignment during user registration
- Verify permission checking for different user roles
- Test protected endpoint access with different permission levels
- Validate role-based access control works with authentication

### Step 4: Session Management Testing
- Test login/logout flow completeness
- Verify session data handling and cleanup
- Test concurrent session handling
- Validate token blacklisting if implemented

### Step 5: End-to-End Workflow Testing
- Complete user registration → login → protected access workflow
- Test various failure scenarios and error handling
- Verify audit logging captures all authentication events
- Test authentication system performance under load

### Files to Test:
- All authentication endpoints via Docker setup
- Protected endpoints requiring authentication
- User management and role assignment functionality

## Success Criteria

- All authentication endpoints return proper HTTP status codes (not 500 errors)
- Admin user can authenticate successfully via API
- User registration workflow completes without errors
- Authentication methods integrate properly with existing RBAC system
- Epic 051 frontend development can proceed with working authentication APIs

## Testing Requirements

- Docker-based testing using: `./docker-compose-local.sh`
- Verify endpoints at http://localhost:3001
- Test authentication workflow end-to-end
- Validate against existing admin user (admin@sprint-reports.com)

## Epic 051 Readiness

This task is critical for unblocking Epic 051 (Frontend Application) development. The frontend cannot proceed without working authentication APIs.
