## Description

Fix critical database schema misalignments identified in architectural audit. Foreign key constraints don't match actual table structure, which could cause runtime failures and data integrity issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fix User/Role relationship foreign key constraints in /backend/app/models/user.py
- [ ] Align Permission model relationships with actual database structure
- [ ] Update SQLAlchemy relationship configurations for proper cascading
- [ ] Create database migration to fix existing schema inconsistencies
- [ ] Add missing database indexes for performance optimization on role/permission queries
- [ ] Validate schema against ADR-002 database architecture requirements
- [ ] Test all database relationships with integration tests
- [ ] Update model documentation to reflect corrected relationships
- [ ] Verify foreign key constraints work correctly in all scenarios
- [ ] Run database integrity checks to ensure no data corruption
