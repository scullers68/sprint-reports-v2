## Description

Develop backend API endpoints to support project portfolio dashboard, providing overview of all projects being worked on in current sprint with project-level metrics and progress tracking.

## Implementation Plan

## ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS PLAN - PROJECT PORTFOLIO DASHBOARD BACKEND API

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
1. Analyze task-080 acceptance criteria for portfolio dashboard API requirements
2. Review existing architecture documentation (ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003)
3. Confirm compliance with microservices architecture and database patterns
4. Identify extension points in existing Sprint, Queue, and Report services

### Phase 2: API Architecture Design
1. Design /api/v1/meta-boards/{board_id}/project-portfolio endpoint structure
2. Design service layer for project metrics aggregation across current sprint
3. Design project completion forecasting API with velocity-based calculations
4. Design project priority rankings and resource allocation endpoints
5. Design caching strategy for expensive aggregation queries

### Phase 3: Service Integration Specification
1. Specify extensions to existing Sprint and Report services
2. Design integration with JIRA service for meta-board project data
3. Specify data models for project health indicators and risk metrics
4. Design filtering and sorting capabilities for portfolio views

### Phase 4: Technical Implementation Specification
1. Create detailed API contract specifications following ADR-003 patterns
2. Specify service layer extensions following existing patterns
3. Design caching implementation using Redis patterns
4. Specify error handling and validation for meta-board requests

### Phase 5: Architecture Documentation and Handoff
1. Create comprehensive architectural specification
2. Document specific files to extend (no new file creation)
3. Provide detailed handoff notes for fullstack-engineer implementation
4. Include risk assessment and integration requirements
