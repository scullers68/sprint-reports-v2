# Sprint Reports v2 - Scope Revision Summary

## Executive Summary

After reviewing application screenshots, Sprint Reports v2 has been realigned as a **read-only analytics and reporting platform**. This document summarizes all changes made to remove features that contradict this vision.

## Vision Clarification

**Sprint Reports v2 is a read-only analytics platform that:**
- ‚úÖ Reads sprint data from JIRA for analysis
- ‚úÖ Generates baseline and comparison reports  
- ‚úÖ Creates capacity-based sprint planning recommendations
- ‚úÖ Publishes reports to Confluence
- ‚ùå **Never modifies JIRA data**

**Core Workflow**: Fetch ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Report ‚Üí Publish

## Documents Updated

### 1. New Strategy Documents Created

   Workers            Field Mapping       Chat Bots
```

### After (Right-Sized)
```
JIRA ‚Üí Read-Only Analytics ‚Üí Sprint Reports ‚Üí Confluence
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                 ‚Üì
  Periodic Sync      Report Generation   Export Formats
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                 ‚Üì
  Cache Layer         Insights Engine    Notifications
```

## Implementation Impact

### Development Time Reduction
- **Estimated 70% reduction** in development complexity
- Focus on analytics excellence vs. complex integrations
- Faster time to market with core features

### Performance Benefits
- Cache-first architecture for fast report generation
- Reduced API calls through periodic sync
- Simplified data models and processing

### Maintenance Benefits
- Simpler codebase with fewer integration points
- Clear read-only boundaries reduce bugs
- Focus on analytics quality vs. sync complexity

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Remove Over-Engineering (Immediate)
1. Mark obsolete tasks as complete (done)
2. Remove bi-directional sync implementation
3. Remove webhook processing system
4. Remove real-time collaboration features

### Phase 2: Implement Analytics Core (Next)
1. Create sprint snapshot models
2. Implement read-only JIRA service
3. Build report generation engine
4. Add Confluence publishing

### Phase 3: Optimize and Polish
