# Sprint Reports Application Rebuild - Product Requirements Document (REVISED)

## Executive Summary

This **revised PRD** aligns Sprint Reports v2 with its true purpose as a **read-only analytics and reporting platform**. After reviewing application screenshots and understanding the actual vision, Sprint Reports v2 is an analytics tool that reads JIRA data, generates insights, and publishes reports - it does NOT modify JIRA data.

## Vision Clarification

**Sprint Reports v2 is a read-only analytics platform focused on:**
- Reading sprint data from JIRA for analysis
- Generating baseline and comparison reports
- Creating capacity-based sprint planning recommendations
- Publishing reports to Confluence
- **Never modifying JIRA data**

**Core Workflow**: Fetch → Analyze → Report → Publish

## Current State Analysis

### Technical Debt Issues (Confirmed)
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Single 5000+ line `app.py` file violating separation of concerns
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Route handlers contain business logic, data processing, and presentation logic
- **Limited Scalability**: SQLite database with JSON serialization for complex data structures  
- **No Automated Testing**: Zero test coverage creating high risk for regressions
- **Security Gaps**: No input validation, CSRF protection, or comprehensive error handling

### Current Capabilities (Aligned with Vision)
- ✅ JIRA API integration for sprint data collection (read-only)
- ✅ Sprint queue generation with fair distribution (planning recommendations)
- ✅ Baseline and comparison reporting with snapshot management
- ✅ Discipline team capacity management for planning
- ✅ Confluence publishing for report distribution
- ✅ Archive system for historical analysis

## Revised Product Vision

## User Stories (Aligned with Vision)

### Sprint Manager Persona
```
As a Sprint Manager,
I want to generate sprint baseline reports automatically
So that I can understand current sprint composition and progress
And identify potential capacity or distribution issues
