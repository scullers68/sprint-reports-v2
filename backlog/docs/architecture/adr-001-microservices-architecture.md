# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Sprint Reports v2 application requires a scalable, maintainable architecture that can handle enterprise-grade workloads while supporting rapid feature development. The existing FastAPI foundation in `/backend/app/main.py` provides a good starting point for microservices implementation.

## Decision
We will implement a microservices architecture using the existing FastAPI framework as the foundation, extending the current service layer pattern seen in `/backend/app/services/`.

### Key Architectural Components:
1. **API Gateway**: Extend existing FastAPI router structure in `/backend/app/api/v1/router.py`
2. **Service Domains**: Build upon existing services (`jira_service.py`, `sprint_service.py`) 
3. **Data Layer**: Leverage existing SQLAlchemy models in `/backend/app/models/`
4. **Configuration**: Extend current Pydantic Settings in `/backend/app/core/config.py`

### Service Boundaries:
- **Sprint Management Service**: Extends existing sprint endpoints and models
- **JIRA Integration Service**: Builds on existing `JiraService` class
- **Reporting Service**: Leverages existing report models and endpoints
- **User Management Service**: Extends existing user authentication patterns
- **Queue Generation Service**: Builds on existing queue models and capacity management

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Leverages existing FastAPI infrastructure and patterns
- Maintains consistency with current codebase structure
- Enables independent scaling of service components
- Supports the existing database models and relationships

### Negative:  
- Requires careful coordination between services
- Complex deployment orchestration
- Network latency between services

## Implementation Notes
- Extend existing router structure rather than creating new API frameworks
- Build upon existing service layer patterns in `/backend/app/services/`
- Leverage current database models and relationships in `/backend/app/models/`
- Use existing configuration management patterns from `/backend/app/core/config.py`
